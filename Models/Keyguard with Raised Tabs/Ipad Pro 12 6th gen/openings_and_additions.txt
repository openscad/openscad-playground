/***********SCREEN and CASE VARIABLES

/***********SCREEN VARIABLES
These special variables can be used to locate screen openings relative to the (0,0) location of the screen opening region

** screen variables
	sh 	screen height
	sw	screen width

	mpp	millimeters per pixel	
	ppm	pixels per millimeter

	nr	number of rows in grid
	nc	number of columns in grid

	tp	top padding - specified in Grid Special Settings
	bp	bottom padding - specified in Grid Special Settings
	lp	left padding - specified in Grid Special Settings
	rp	right padding - specified in Grid Special Settings
	
** cell variables (the value is in millimeters)
	cw	cell width (doesn't apply to cells that are affected by left/right compensation for tight cases)

	ccr	cell corner radius

	hor	height of ridge - specified in Grid Special Settings
	tor	thickness of ridge - specified in Grid Special Settings

/***********CAMERA and HOME BUTTON VARIABLES
Since the home button and camera are always located in the same place relative to the screen and have nothing to do with how the tablet sits in the case, any openings that you create associated with the home button or camera should be described in the screen_openings data structure rather than the case_openings data structure.  Note that all the measurements in this set are in millimeters.  If you use these in a design that assumes all measurements are in pixels, multiply the variable times ppm (pixels per millimeter).

	hloc	home button location: 1,2,3,4 (adjusted for orientation)
	hbd	distance from screen to home button in millimeters
	hbh	home button height in millimeters
	hbw	home button width in millimeters
	cloc	camera location: 1,2,3,4 (adjusted for orientation)
	cmd	distance from screen to camera in millimeters
	cmh	camera height in millimeters
	cmw	camera width in millimeters

	sch	yes/no, has the camera and home button been swapped so that the camera is on right and home button is on left?
	sxo	sign of x offset, if measuring from standard home/camera locations
	syo	sign of y offset, if measuring from standard home/camera locations
	
	xols	x location of the left side of the case opening adjusted for swapping camera and home button
	xors	x location of the right side of the case opening adjusted for swapping camera and home button
	yobs	y location of the bottom side of the case opening adjusted for swapping the camera and home button
	yots	y location of the top side of the case opening adjusted for swapping the camera and home button



/***********CASE VARIABLES
These special variables can be used to locate openings and place additions relative to the (0,0) location of the case opening
[Note that the (0,0) location of the case opening is not absolute and can move if the screen doesn't sit in the middle of the opening.  These variables are independent of that movement. All variables are in millimeters]
	coh	case opening height - specified in Case Info
	cow 	case opening width - specified in Case Info
	cocr	case opening corner radius - specified in Case Info

	kh	keyguard height - specified in Keyguard Frame Info

	kcr	keyguard corner radius - specified in Keyguard Frame Info
	rh	rail height (also keyguard thickness)
	hrw	horizontal rail width
	vrw	vertical rail width

	w 	width of the opening for the keyguard independent of whether this is a keyguard or a keyguard frame
	h	height of the opening for the keyguard independent of whether this is a keyguard or a keyguard frame

		   

/***********TABLET VARIABLES
	th     height of tablet in millimeters
